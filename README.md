# Bibtex shorten DOI
Convert the DOI fields of a BibTeX file to shortened DOI names (see http://shortdoi.org)
This is helpful if you want to include DOI links using the Latex DOI package but wish to avoid having huge DOI names in your paper's references section.

## Usage

```bibtex_shorten_doi.py <.bib file name>```
